# Simple Evolutionary Algorithm with QUBO Problem
This repository is a fork of an original implementation in Java. The original repository was created by Francisco Chicano for the course "Evolutionary Algorithms" of the Master in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence of the University of Malaga (Spain).

This has been modified for practical purposes for the subject. The following changes have been made to the original implementation:

- The algorithm has been adapted to solve instances of the QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem.
-  Running the algorithm with different parameter configurations.
